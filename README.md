# UX

## Project Goals

This site has been built solely for the purpose of the 2nd milestone project and will not be used in any real world application so as not to infringe any trademarked content.

16. As a **Site Owner** I want the site to be responsive to whatever device the user is using.

## User Requirements and Expectations

1. The website should include:
   - An interactive quiz that provides feedback to the user as they progress through.
   - A list of football songs provided direct from a spotify API that can be interacted with.
   - A navigation bar that enables easy transition between pages and is responsive to what device it is viewed on.
   - A feedback form that sends an email direct to the site owner with comments from the user about their experience with the site.
   - Data from football databases pulled into the site via an API to give the user the most up to date information.
2. The website should be interactive, provide feedback and confirmation to the user and validate any data entered by the user. It also needs to be aesthetic and intuitive to use.

# Design Choices

With this site I want to primarily create an interactive quiz based on the Premier League. In addition I want to bring in additional information from other sources and websites to provide a more interactive experience for the user. With that in mind the site still needs to look great and be responsive to different media screens. I don't want it to look cluttered so will go with a sleek minimal design that gains inspiration from the Premier League colours and design itself.
## Colors
Color scheme has been kept minimal so that the user is not overwhelmed when playing the game or looking at the information. An accent color of a light blue was used throughout to keep a consistent look and feel as the user navigates through the site.

## Fonts
I have used Noto Sans JP for the body text and Roboto for the headers. Both fonts are from google fonts and compliment each other well. I have used sans-serif as a back up font should the browser the user is using cannot load the google fonts.
